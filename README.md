# PWA-Budget

This is a progressive web app. It is designed to help the user keep track of their finances. They are able to name 
each transaction, add and subtract from their balance. All of the users transactions are then listed with each 
transaction name and amount. There is also a graph that gives a visual representation of the flow of funds in and out 
of the account. 
 This particular app will allow the user to continue using the app even after internet connection is interrupted. It 
 will save the data submitted as cached data and upload the new offline data after internet connection is restored.
 
 I did the mistake of working on this project overnight and forgot to keep pushing my progress up. So it looks like I
 magically conjured this whole app :D
 
 The app is not very esthetically pleasing and that is something I do plan to add to this project. Splash some color on it. 
 While I prefer materialize, I will be using bootstrap for this project. I will also be deploying the app onto Heroku.
